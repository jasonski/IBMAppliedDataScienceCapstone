# Coursera - IBM - Applied Data Science Course
This project was created in the course of the Coursera class IBM - Applied Data Science. 
The main piece of work is the Capstone Project of the course. 

# Capstone Project - Battle of the Neighborhoods
In the capstone project the data science approach to the following question is executed:
**Where is the best location to open a new burger place in the city of Berlin, Germany?**

A **report** is written answering that question, where data collection, exploration, wrangling and analysis are explained in detail. The report can be found [here](https://github.com/jasonski/IBMAppliedDataScienceCapstone/blob/master/BJB_fullreport.md).

A **presentation** is provided that summarizes the analysis in few slides. It can be found [here](https://github.com/jasonski/IBMAppliedDataScienceCapstone/blob/master/CapstoneProjectBJBPresentation.pdf).

The report is based on previous **data collection and analysis** performed in **python jupyter notebooks**, accessible here:
